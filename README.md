# ESLab_HW2-Socket-Programming-and-Data-Visualization

I executed main.cpp, which is modified by mbed-os-example-sockets, on STM32 as client, and socket.py on my laptop as server.


STM32 would send the 3d accelerator data to the laptop through wifi, and the data would be visualized by using matplotlib.pyplot.
